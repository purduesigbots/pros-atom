# PROS for Atom

[![GitHub version](https://badge.fury.io/gh/purduesigbots%2Fpros-atom.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/gh/purduesigbots%2Fpros-atom)

PROS is the only open source development environment for the VEX EDR Platform.

This plugin provides support for Atom, the official IDE of the PROS Development Team. For PROS-specific functionality, it interacts with the [PROS CLI](https://github.com/purduesigbots/pros-cli).

The main repository for the PROS kernel is located at https://github.com/purduesigbots/pros

The PROS plugin provides the following functionality, in addition to being a UI for the CLI:
 - Autocomplete (provider for [autocomplete-plus](https://atom.io/plugins/autocomplete-plus) and fork of [autocomplete-clang](https://atom.io/plugins/autocomplete-clang))
 - Linting (fork of [linter-gcc](https://atom.io/plugins/linter-gcc))
 - Building (provider for [build](https://atom.io/plugins/build))

## Installation
