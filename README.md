# PROS for Atom

PROS is the only open source development environment for the VEX EDR Platform.

This plugin provides support for Atom, the official IDE of the PROS Development Team. For PROS-specific functionality, it interacts with the [PROS CLI](https://github.com/purduesigbots/pros-cli).

The main repository for the PROS kernel is located at https://github.com/purduesigbots/pros

The PROS plugin provides the following functionality, in addition to being a UI for the CLI:
 - Autocomplete (provider for [autocomplete-plus](https://atom.io/plugins/autocomplete-plus) and fork of [autocomplete-clang](https://atom.io/plugins/autocomplete-clang))
 - Linting (fork of [linter-gcc](https://atom.io/plugins/linter-gcc))
 - Building (provider for [build](https://atom.io/plugins/build))

## Installation
To install PROS for Atom, download [Atom](https://atom.io), [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org), and the latest [PROS toolchain/CLI](https://github.com/purduesigbots/pros/releases/latest).
